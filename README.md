PHYSICS
I added physics so the player bounces back after hitting a wall instead of hitting the wall and stopping.
I also added torque to the character so the movement slows to a stop rather than going from moving to immediately stopped. This gave the character movement a more realistic feeling. I used this unity AddTorque tutorial as a reference https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/3d-physics?signup=true#5c7f8528edbc2a002053b513.

BILLBOARD
Since the game is set inside a computer, I added a computer case billboards above the maze that is suppose to make the player the feel like they are trapped inside a pc.

LIGHTS
I added a blue spotlight that lights up the objective printed on the wall when the player starts. I angled it so the light is coming from below to give it a dramatic look. The blue goes with the textures chosen for the computer architecture theme. I also added green spotlights above each of the RAM blocks that the player is suppose to collect. The green matches the color of the RAM and serves as a hint to the player to find the blocks.

SOUND
I added a bird chirping sound that happens when the player collides with a RAM block. I also added a bumping sound that occurs if the player runs into one of the outer walls. My thinking was that the chirping sound was happy so it plays when the player collects RAM blocks (completing the game objective) and the bump sound effect is bad to discourage the player from running into the walls.
